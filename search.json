    "text": "Life expectancy varies significantly across countries due to differences in health and socioeconomic conditions. I used a dataset compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), available on Kaggle, which includes health and economic indicators from 2000 to 2015 for over 190 countries. After cleaning and standardizing the data, I explored how health factors (such as disease prevalence and vaccination rates) and economic indicators (such as education and GDP) relate to life expectancy.\nI built a multiple linear regression model to predict life expectancy, measured in years, using predictors including mortality rates, disease prevalence, access to vaccines, income levels, and education. The analysis revealed that HIV/AIDS and adult mortality rates had the strongest negative impacts on life expectancy, while higher levels of schooling and income composition were positively associated with longer life expectancy."
