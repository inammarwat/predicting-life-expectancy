# Predicting Life Expectancy

_A data science project using statistical modeling to understand the factors influencing global life expectancy._

## 📊 Project Summary

Life expectancy is one of the most critical indicators of a nation’s well-being. This project explores which health and socio-economic factors most strongly predict life expectancy across countries. Using data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), we examine global life expectancy trends with the goal of understanding how factors like adult mortality, HIV/AIDS prevalence, GDP, and education influence outcomes. We used a multiple linear regression model to quantify relationships and generate actionable insights.
