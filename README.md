# Predicting Life Expectancy

ðŸ‘‰ [View the Quarto Website](https://github.com/inammarwat/predicting-life-expectancy)

This project investigates the relationship between various health, economic, and social factors and life expectancy across countries. Using a statistical model, we predict life expectancy based on key indicators such as adult mortality, GDP, education levels, and HIV/AIDS prevalence. The analysis helps highlight which factors most strongly affect longevity, especially in developing countries. The project is part of a data science bootcamp and is presented as a Quarto website.
