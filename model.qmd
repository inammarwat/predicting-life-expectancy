## Model Specification

We fit a multiple linear regression model to predict **life expectancy** based on several key health and socioeconomic indicators.

The model is defined as:

$$
\text{Life Expectancy} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Adult Mortality} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Income Composition of Resources} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{HIV/AIDS} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{Schooling} + \beta_5 \cdot \log(\text{GDP} + 1) + \epsilon
$$

Where:

- $\beta_0$ is the intercept
- $\epsilon$ is the error term

## Model Coefficients

Below are the estimated coefficients of the model, including 95% confidence intervals:

| Term                           | Estimate | Std. Error | t value | p-value    | 95% CI (Lower) | 95% CI (Upper) |
|--------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Intercept                      | 51.20    | 0.57       | 89.7    | < 0.001     | 50.00          | 52.30          |
| Adult Mortality                | -0.0194  | 0.00097    | -19.9   | < 0.001     | -0.0213        | -0.0175        |
| Income Composition of Resources| 10.80    | 0.85       | 12.7    | < 0.001     | 9.13           | 12.50          |
| HIV/AIDS                       | -0.444   | 0.0186     | -23.9   | < 0.001     | -0.480         | -0.407         |
| Schooling                      | 0.986    | 0.0574     | 17.2    | < 0.001     | 0.873          | 1.10           |
| log(GDP + 1)                   | 0.479    | 0.0681     | 7.03    | < 0.001     | 0.345          | 0.612          |

### Interpretation

- **Adult Mortality** and **HIV/AIDS** are strongly associated with *lower* life expectancy.
- **Schooling**, **Income Composition**, and **GDP** are positively associated with *higher* life expectancy.
- All predictors are statistically significant at p < 0.001.
